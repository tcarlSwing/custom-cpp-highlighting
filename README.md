# README
This is my first vscode extension.

I wanted to create a syntax highlighter similar to the one used in Microsoft's Visual Studio.

This highlighter relies on Jeff Hykin's Better C++ Syntax parser, so the Better C++ Syntax extension will also be installed with this extension.

This highlighter also provides coloring for CMake files based on the twxs.cmake extension,
which provided both syntax parsing and highlighting for CMake files. My colorization uses the syntax parsing provided in the twxs.cmake extension, and it follows
a similar, if not the same, color scheme as the other extension, but I needed to include the colors into this colorizer for the coloring to appear.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please let me know.

**Enjoy!**
