# README
This is my first vscode extension.

I wanted to create a syntax highlighter similar to the one used in Microsoft's Visual Studio.

This highlighter relies on Jeff Hykin's Better C++ Syntax parser, so the Better C++ Syntax extension will also be installed with this extension.

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please let me know.

**Enjoy!**
